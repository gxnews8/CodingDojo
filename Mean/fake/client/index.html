<!-- there are three mistakes, right off the bat. -->
<!-- 1. ng-app should be attached a body element, not DOCTYPE -->
<!-- 2. angular routes are chained by (.) period, and not by commas. There was an extra comma -->
<!-- 3. We stated bower_components to be our STATIC folder (via express static), so we should pull script src from folders and files IN bower_components. That means leaving bower_components out of the path -->
<!-- 4. In the index controller you are using location rather than $location, which is the actual parameter -->
